# Cryptanalysis of a Substitution Cipher

An L-Symbol challenge ciphertext was given that we were tasked to decrypt. Two different tests are taken to decrypt the given ciphertext. Our goal was to replicate the encryption scheme and figure out the best way that they can be decrypted. In the first test we are given five plain texts and our goal is to find a match between one of the samples and cipher text.  The second test involves using a dictionary text to decrypt the given ciphertext.
